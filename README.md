Fighter-Bomber 2020
===================

A two player vertical scrolling shooter against air and ground enemies.

This is a revisiting of an old game idea I had that I started during the 2020
Global Game Jam (although not for it). I may continue with this in which case
I'll have to do some clean up as although I got all the basics it is a mess &
there isn't much content.
